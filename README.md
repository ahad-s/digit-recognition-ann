Standard ANN implementation using BackProp/ForwardProp with 1 hidden layer, current training setting has 100 hidden neurons.\n Regularization parameters currently need to be adjusted and are not at optimal values.

Refer to bottom of ann.py on how to change initial parameters (regularization constant LAMBDA, neurons in hidden layer, etc.).

Total training examples available: 6000
Total test examples available: 2000

WARNING: Training takes a while and a good CPU is recommended for >100 training examples with current hidden neurons. If you want to use the pre_trained data, change LOAD_FROM_FILE to False at the bottom of ann.py
